# RSA Encryption with Certificate - Java

## Description

This Java repository demonstrates the implementation of RSA encryption and decryption using certificates. It provides a comprehensive example of securing data with RSA encryption, including key generation, message encryption, and decryption. Additionally, it showcases how to use certificates for public key distribution and signature verification.

## Key Features

- **RSA Encryption/Decryption:** Learn how to use the RSA algorithm for secure data communication.

- **Certificate Handling:** Understand how to generate key pairs, create certificates, and use them for encryption and verification.

- **Signature Verification:** Explore the process of signing and verifying data to ensure its integrity and authenticity.

- **Java Security APIs:** Utilize Java's security libraries and APIs for cryptographic operations.

## Usage

1. **Key Pair Generation:**
    - Generate RSA key pairs for encryption and decryption.

2. **Certificate Creation:**
    - Create X.509 certificates for secure key distribution.

3. **Encryption:**
    - Encrypt sensitive data using the public key from the certificate.

4. **Decryption:**
    - Decrypt the encrypted data using the private key.

5. **Signature Verification:**
    - Sign data with the private key and verify the signature using the public key.

## Dependencies

- **Bouncy Castle:** The example uses the Bouncy Castle provider for cryptographic operations.
